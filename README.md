# luamodules-all-in-one-file

Embeding all lua modules/files of a project into only one lua file

Note: it's an Alpha version.

# Why using this util ?

I currently use this util in 2 projects :
 * for Alephone Game
  because the Lua Script support only support ONE Lua file to load.
  Having one big file is too ugly for me, I prefere split all part to lua modules and generate the big one at the end.
 * In fakelove
 A implementation of LÃ–VE in pur lua (without graphical stuff) usefull for server side code game.


# How it run

This util catch each module files and push their contents inside the preload table.
By this way we can use `require("modulename")` like usual.
